I am a current PhD student at the University of Maryland College Park, studying ocean dynamics, climate, and physical-biological interactions at high latitudes (with Prof. [Jim Carton](https://www2.atmos.umd.edu/~carton)). I am particularly interested in the long-term effects of "Atlantification" and "Pacification" on the biology and water properties in the Arctic, in particular how these environmental drivers are resulting in changes to the structure of the upper ocean and the seasonal cycles of phytoplankton production. Due to the sparse and seasonally-limited nature of observations at high latitudes, I make use of a wide range of techniques which synthesize satellite-derived observations, in situ observations, and global and regional models. Most often, I make use of Data assimilation methods to combine multiple data and model sources in order to construct a best estimate of the historical or present ocean state.
