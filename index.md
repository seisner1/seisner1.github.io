I am a current PhD student at the University of Maryland College Park, studying ocean dynamics, climate, and physical-biological interactions at high latitudes. I am particularly interested in the long-term effects of Atlantification and Pacification on the biology and water properties in the Arctic. I primarily make use of ocean reanalyses and data assimilation to synthesize remotely sensed satellite data with global and regional models.
