## Pan-Arctic Seasonal Mixed Layer Dynamics
The Arctic as a whole is well-known for it's complicated vertical structure which consists of layers of seasonal water mass remnants, advected subpolar water masses, and river outflows. This can lead to a complex and highly variable mixed layer structure throughout the Arctic. I am currently using a suite of ocean reanalyses to reconstruct a seasonal pan-Arctic mixed layer climatology, with a primary interest in cataloguing the difference in seasonal mixed layer characteristics amongst the various Arctic shelves. 

## Trends and Variability in Arctic Atlantic Water in the Central Arctic

I am currently investigating long-term trends in the transport of Atlantic Water into the Amerasian Basin. The Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current is known to carry warm, salty Atlantic Water into the Eurasian Basin, where some amount of that water crosses the Lomonosov Ridge into the Amerasian Arctic. However, limited observations have made it difficult to assess long-term trends in the transport of Atlantic Water past the ridge or how that transport has varied in time.

Using the [SODA4](https://soda.umd.edu) reanalysis developed in our lab, I am trying to understand how much the heat transport by Atlantic Water has increased in recent decades and what the dominant modes of variability are. I am particularly interested in understanding if the increases in transport of Atlantic Water to the Amerasian Basin have resulted in changes to the structure and concentration of nutrients and the location of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum, as has recently been observed in the Eurasian Arctic [[1]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq7580).

## Effects of Atlantification on Amerasian Phytoplankton

Using the SODA4 reanalysis alongside satellite observations from the MODIS-AQUA and PACE platforms, I am investigating if the increase in heat transport into the Amerasian Basin has resulted in changes to upper ocean mixing, mixed layer depth, and sea ice coverage and if these manifest in satellite ocean color observations. The mixed layer depth and sea ice concentration are key moderators of phytoplankton primary production at high latitudes due to strong light limitations. Increases in heat content, particularly in the upper oceans, may act to shoal the mixed layer of Pacific Surface Water and melt sea ice, changing the timing of the phytoplankton growing season.

Additionally, I am interested in assessing the role of atmospheric climate patterns (such as the Arctic Dipole Anomaly) in modulating phytoplankton phenology.

## Blended Ocean Surface Currents

Blended Ocean Surface Currents (BOSC) is a 1/6 degree global, near-real time ocean surface curent product. It builds upon the work of other well-known ocean current products, such as the Copernicus GlobCurrent and the OSCARv2. All of these products make use of satellite altimetry and surface winds to reconstruct a best estimate of the near-surface Geostrophic and Ekman currents. BOSC augments this methodology to include additional constraints based on satellite tracer obserations. Currently, BOSC incorporates observations of Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice motion vectors to improve performance in the tropics and high latitudes, where Geostrophy and Ekman balance break down.
