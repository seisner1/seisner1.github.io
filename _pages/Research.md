## Trends and Variability in Arctic Atlantic Water in the Central Arctic

I am currently investigating long-term trends in the transport of Atlantic Water into the Amerasian Basin. The Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current is known to carry warm, salty Atlantic Water into the Eurasian Basin, where some amount of that water crosses the Lomonosov Ridge into the Amerasian Arctic. However, limited observations have made it difficult to assess long-term trends in the transport of Atlantic Water past the ridge or how that transport has varied in time.

Using the [SODA4](https://soda.umd.edu) reanalysis developed in our lab, I am trying to understand how much the heat transport by Atlantic Water has increased in recent decades and what the dominant modes of variability are. I am particularly interested in understanding if the increases in transport of Atlantic Water to the Amerasian Basin have resulted in changes to the structure and concentration of nutrients and the location of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum, as has recently been observed in the Eurasian Arctic by (Polyakov et al., 2025)[DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adq7580]
