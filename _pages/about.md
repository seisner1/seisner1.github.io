title: "About Me"

---

Prior to my current position at the University of Maryland, I completed an undergraduate degree in Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. While there, I did research in dynamical systems, with a focus on fluid dynamics and biophysical systems (ranging from ecological models to cardiac models). I have always been particularly interested in understanding how systems of living things are affected by their environment and how these interactions can be described mathematically.

Beyond my academic work, I am extremely passionate about earth systems, ecology, and environmental science. I am most at home in nature and spend a significant amount of my free time outdoors and volunteering with children to teach basic concepts in earth sciences, land stewardship, and sustainability.
